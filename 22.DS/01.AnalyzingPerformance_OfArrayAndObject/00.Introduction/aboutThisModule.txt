Alright so now we will use the knowledge of Big-O and use it to analyse some of the built in Data Structure 

which are :Arrays and Object

Objectives Of this module :

1.Understand How objects and arrays work,through the lens of Big-O

2.Explain why adding element to the beginning of an array is costly. and check if there are alternatives or if there is a better way of inerting 


3.And then Compare and Contrast the runtime for arrays and object as well as built in methods
