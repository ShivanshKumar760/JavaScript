Alright so as we mentioned in the last module,one of the biggest challenges for new developer ,new programmers is


->Solving problem cause for most people it's easy to learn syntax and 
we can copy other people's code or remake an application following a step by step instruction.

But the hardest thing has to do with solving new 
problems and new challenges and we do tend to get better at this with time regardless of the 
technologiess we use or the programming language we are working with and problem solving is an 
important skill and lot of it will naturally come with time 

But it's worth having a game plan to follow step by step guide basically.

it's not going to solve your problems for ypu , but it helps you sit and think about and break problems 

and it helps solution come about naturally .

Lets start with understanding the problem:

->so if we are prensted with a problem here are the things which we should ask ourself and the interviewer

i.Can we restate the problem in our own words?

ii.What are the input or types of input that go into the problem ?

iii.What are the output that should come from the solution to the problem? 


iV.Can the outputs be determined from the inputs?In other words ,do i have enough information to solve the problem?

v.How should I label the important peices of data that are a part of the problemm ?


Lets take a example to run through these steps:

Ex:Write a function which takes two number and return their sum:


let's break it down :

1.repharase :basiclly pass two parameters in the function and return back there sum

2.Types of input will be number here we will take integer not floating point number and also limit the upper bound value 

3.so a single output will come which will sum of two parameter 

4.if input value are 3 and 7 output should be 10
but what if someone dosent give the second number input should we display zero , null undefined or add zero these question can be ask to interviwer


5.important labels :function name can be add()
->arguments can be label as num1 and num2 for more clearity
