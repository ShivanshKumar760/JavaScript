Alright Welcome back,

So let's move on to part three ie step three of solving a problem ar least trying to

Till now what we did is :
1.understood the problem

2.Explore Concrete Example 

Now time to Break down the problem and write the task which needs to be preformed

it dosent have to be a full pseudocode or valid syntax,just a little comment as a guide

So it's recommended to explicitly write down the steps that we will take in order to solve problem

it dosen't have to be ton of details and it dosent have to be line by line 

just the basic component of the solution,and this forces us to think about the code before we write it so that 
we are not just free wheeling and trying to come up with it on the fly.


So lets break down a problem:

Ex:Write a function which takes in a string and returns counts of each character in the string


->Lets type up a skeleton:


function charCount(string)
{
	//do something 
	//return an object with keys that are lower case alphanumeric character in the string-the value should be count of character

	//lets break down
	0.make a object


	->So to count the ocurrence of character we will have to visit ed ach character ie we will have to iterate over string usin loop

	1.loop over string-to check each character.

	->and we have to lowercase each character 
	to add it in the object andwe have to 
	check if the character at which the 
	pointer is at is already in the object or
	 not cause if it is we will just have to 
	 increment it by 1 or else we will have 
	 to add it 

	 2.if the char is a number/letter and key in object ,add one  to count

	 3.if the char is a number/letter AND not in object ,add it to object and set value to 1

->and then we will have to check for special character (space,period,etc) if there dont do it 
	4.if character is something else(space,period,etc) dont do anything


//return object
